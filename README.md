## IMPORTANT
lambda is barely functional right now, and will be in this state for quite a bit (few weeks maybe), this section will be removed when it is stable and ready for regular usage.  

## Info
lambda is an X11 tiling window manager built in the spirit of XMonad, and DWM. I want to create lambda to improve on XMonad and DWM and learn about the X protocol at the same time.

## Q&A
Q: "Why aren't you using wayland? X11 is old and crappy"  
A: You are correct, X11 is old and hasn't improved much since a decade ago, however in the end there are many small problems in wayland (especially with nvidia) that make it inconvenient to switch to creating a wayland compositor. (see https://gist.github.com/probonopd/9feb7c20257af5dd915e3a9f2d1f2277 for more info)    

Q: "Where is the ___ implementation?"  
A: If lambda is missing a feature (and isn't on the TODO list below) and you deem it important, create an issue and tell me what you would like.

## Features (All will be implemented at some point)
- [X] Keybinding System
- [ ] EWMH/ICCM (No plans for this YET)
- [X] Window Tiling
- [ ] r/unixporn Compatible (Lacking decoration/gaps)
- [ ] IPC
- [ ] Docks/Bars/Strut support
- [ ] Wiki/Guide
- [ ] Screenshots

## Active bugs (Check means fixed)
- [X] Running neofetch in urxvt spawns a ghost window

## Configuration
Configuration guide will be on the wiki which will be created when lambda is stable.
